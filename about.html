				<h2>Tirso Peguero</h2>
				<p>I'm one of those guys that likes problems. I like them because they have to be <em>solved</em> and the solving part can be really interesting. I've discovered over the last few years that my favorite problems are coding problems (I'm not currently taking any additional marriage counseling clients). I especially like those tricky problems that make you question the how or why of the project and force you to rethink your implementation.</p>
				<p>I've been working with computers since before Windows 95 was released (does anyone else remember those 13 beige-colored 3.5" floppy disks?). I first started playing games on a Commodore 64 when I was a wee lad and soon graduated to piecing together computers with my dad - using DOS at first and then staying up late at night to install Windows. I'm also probably one of the few kids that went to web-dev summer camp in 5th grade. Fast-forward to college and I'm studying Military History and Russian Language while working tier 1 support for my school. I had taken a couple of CS classes and was not enjoying them for some reason - I was too young to recognize that it was a lack of real-world projects that frustrated me.</p>
          <p>I had originally planned to enter the Marine Corps after school but chose instead to come here to San Francisco to explore a career in tech since I've always loved working with computers. After working through several technical support positions I landed an entry level job with an advertising technology company that I grew into a product management role. After realizing that what I really wanted to do was <strong>build</strong> things I had no choice but to make the switch to engineering.</p>

				<p>Some of my most recent projects are posted on the main page, but there's more on my github and. Go ahead and check out the links at the bottom of this page to see the rest of my online presence. If you've got some cool problems to work on and please drop me a line.</p>
